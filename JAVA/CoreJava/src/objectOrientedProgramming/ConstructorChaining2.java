		  ðŸ”¹ But when an object of Demo22 is created,
		     the parent constructor Demo11() is executed automatically
		     because of an implicit call to super() in Demo22 constructor.
		  
		  ðŸ”¹ Reason:
		     Every constructor (child or parent) must ensure its
		     superclass is fully constructed first â†’ Java does this by calling super()
		  
		  ðŸ”¸ Note:
		     Even though Demo11's constructor is not inherited, 
		     it still runs when you create a Demo22 object â€” 
		     because the compiler adds `super();` as the first line of Demo22()

    <h1>How many types we can declare the variable</h1>
    <h3>4 types</h3>
    <p>1. Automatically</p>
    <p>2. using var</p>
    <p>3. using let</p>
    <p>4. using const</p>

    <script>
        // 1. Automatically (without var, let, or const)
        // Variables declared without a keyword become global variables.
        // This can accidentally override existing global variables, leading to bugs.
        // Not recommended in modern JavaScript.
        var1 = "Hello";
        console.log("The value is :" + var1);
        console.log("The type is :" + typeof var1);


        // 2. Var
        // Can be redeclared (e.g., var var2 = 50;)
        // Can be reassigned (e.g., var2 = 100;)
        // Function-scoped (Only accessible inside the function where it is declared)
        // Hoisted: var declarations are automatically moved to the top of their function during execution, but the value is 'undefined' until the code reaches the assignment line
        var var2 = 24;
        //var var2 = 45; // redeclaration
        var2 = 67; // reassignment
        console.log("The value is :" + var2);
        console.log("The type is :" + typeof var2);

        // 3. Let
        // block-scoped (only accessible within the block where it is declared) - block means anything within {} i.e if, for loop, while loop etc
        // can be reassigned but cannot be redeclared in the same scope
        let var3 = true;
        //let var3 = false; // redeclaration will throw an error
        var3 = false; // reassignment is allowed
        console.log("The value is :" + var3);
        console.log("The type is :" + typeof var3);

        // 4. const
        // block-scoped that is only accessible within the block where it is declared
        // cannot be reassigned and also cannot be redeclared in the same scope
        // must be initialized during declaration
        const var4 = 121n;
        console.log("The value is :" + var4);
        console.log("The type is :" + typeof var4);
    </script>

    <script>
        // Difference between var, let and const
        // re declaring

        // var- can declare more then once 
        var var1 = 23;
        console.log("1st:", var1);

        var var1 = "Hello";
        console.log("2nd:", var1)

        // let - cant use same variable again but we can initailaize as below
        let var12 = "Var12";
        console.log("let 1st:"+ var12);
        var12 = 12;
        console.log("let 1st:", var12);

        // const- cant reuse the variable and also cannont redefine the variable
        const pi = 3.14;
        console.log("const 1st:", pi)
        pi = 23.4;
        console.log("const 2nd:", pi)
